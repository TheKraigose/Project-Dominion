Project Dominion README::

To build, zip up the data folder and all lua files into a .love file.

I reccomend for GUI users to use 7Zip on Windows.

People on Linux/Unix/Mac OS X probably know of better ways ;P

Then run with Love2D.

A better manual will be designed, but for now:

Controls once in a game:
W -> Move Forward
S -> Move Backward
Left Arrow -> Rotate Counter Clockwise
Right Arrow -> Rotate Clockwise
E -> Fire Weapon
1, 2 and 3 select the different weapons, but you need to pick them up first.

Weapons:

Trusty Handgun -> A basic pistol, has unlimited ammo but it also can't auto-fire
Submachine Gun -> The tommy gun of the enemy auto-fires, but isn't as fast as...
Chaingun -> CHAINGUUUUUUUUUUUN. Oh heck yes.
