Project Dominion README::

To build, zip up the data folder and all lua files into a .love file.

I reccomend for GUI users to use 7Zip on Windows. Save the file as "projdom1.love". The extension is important.

People on Linux/Unix/Mac OS X probably know of better ways ;P

Then run with Love2D.

A better manual will be designed, but for now:

Controls once in a game:
W -> Move Forward
S -> Move Backward
Left Arrow -> Rotate Counter Clockwise
Right Arrow -> Rotate Clockwise
E -> Fire Weapon
1, 2 and 3 select the different weapons, but you need to pick them up first.

Weapons:

Trusty Handgun -> A basic pistol, has unlimited ammo but it also can't auto-fire
Submachine Gun -> The tommy gun of the enemy auto-fires, but isn't as fast as...
Chaingun -> CHAINGUUUUUUUUUUUN. Oh heck yes.

This game is open source. You may use the code for any purpose, provided you give credit to me and pass the open source license on. (Only applies to my LUA files)

However, please refrain from using my assets other than for testing/seeing how it works. Do not reuse in commercial.
